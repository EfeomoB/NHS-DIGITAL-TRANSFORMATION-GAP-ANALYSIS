# NHS Digital Transformation Gap Analysis

A comprehensive business analysis of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK to identify gaps between current service delivery and the “Digital First” future state envisioned in NHS strategy.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
This repository contains a structured gap analysis to support NHS digital transformation efforts aimed at improving patient care, streamlining services, and enhancing secure data sharing across trusts, hospitals, and clinics.

The analysis highlights the most impactful gaps between the current state and the “Digital First” strategic direction and offers actionable recommendations to close those gaps.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Despite major investment in digital technologies, the NHS still faces significant challenges:

- Long patient wait times  
- Poor integration between systems (e.g., GP and hospital records)  
- Low patient engagement with digital services  
- Siloed departments and duplicated processes  

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives
This project aims to:

- Identify key gaps between current processes and future-state goals  
- Understand stakeholder pain points (clinicians, patients, administrators)  
- Provide actionable, prioritised recommendations  
- Support the NHS Digital transformation roadmap

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodology
A range of business-analysis frameworks and methods were used:

- **Fishbone (Root Cause Analysis)**  
- **SWOT Analysis**  
- **PESTLE Analysis**  
- **McKinsey 7S Model**  
- Process mapping, user journeys, and stakeholder insights
